# hemophilia-A-FVIII-ML

Project: Hema-Class framework

Description: Prediction of hemophilia A severity using a small-input machine learning framework

All classification codes are organized into folder: hemophilia-A-FVIII-ML/src/ml.
The regression codes can be found at hemophilia-A-FVIII-ML/src/ml/regression.

To reproduce all experiments using individual ML classification models on the training dataset, please verify the source codes: 
- prediction-visualization.R
- prediction-visualization-aug.R

To reproduce all experiments using regression, please run the code "run-all.R" located at regression folder.

All pre-trained classification models are stored in the Result folder.
